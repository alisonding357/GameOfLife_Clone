# GameOfLife_Clone
 
My clone of the cellular automaton, Game of Life, by John Conway.

Buttons:
1. Click "Play/Pause" to begin/stop the animation
2. Click "Step" to go one stage forward, according to the rules of the game
3. Click "Clear" to clear the squares on the board
4. Click "Generate Random" to generate a random pattern on the board

You can click and drag your mouse over the grid to color in tiles and create custom patterns. Clicking on the board while the animation is playing will cause the animation to pause, and you can begin drawing.
